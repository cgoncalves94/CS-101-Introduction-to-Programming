About The Game

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
How To Play
The game is started on a grid of unrevealed cells. Some randomly selected cells are designated as containing mines. Most cells, however, are devoid of mines. When a cell is revealed, it shows the number of mines that are in the eight cells surrounding it. If none of these eight cells have mines, then they will also be automatically revealed. The game is won when all cells not containing a mine have been revealed.
